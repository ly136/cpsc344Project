In order to push to this, go to the folder where you cloned this project and in the folder that has the work you did, do the following:
git add -A (instead of -A, you can upload a specific file too like Script1.cs or texture1.png)
git commit -m "description of what you edited"
git push -u origin master

And to pull, just go to the directory that's created when you cloned this and do:
git pull

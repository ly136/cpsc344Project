# cpsc344Project
This contains the Unity files needed in order to make our game. 

## In order to push to this, go to the folder where you cloned this project and in the folder that has the work you did, do the following:
- git add -A (instead of -A, you can upload a specific file too like Script1.cs or texture1.png)
- git commit -m "description of what you edited"
- git push -u origin master

## And to update the copy you have, just go to the directory that's created when you first cloned this and do:
- git pull
